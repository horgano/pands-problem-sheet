# Week 01 Task
# hello_world.py

A program that outputs the statement "Hello World".



## Week 02 Task
## bank.py

A program that read 2 integers in cents and outputs the sum of those integers in Euro format.

Here I just wanted to show separately the 3 different ways of creating output. 


### Week 03 Task 
### accounts.py

https://learnpython.com/blog/substring-of-string-python/#:~:text=Much%20like%20arrays%20and%20lists,substring%20of%20the%20original%20string.

A program that firstly reads in a 10 digit number and outputs first 6 numbers 
replaced with X's and final 4 numbers as they are.

Testing would be needed to ensure initial number is numeric and of length 10.
While above works, the input entered incorrectly, so can be entered as alphanumeric by mistake so result can still be incorrect.
This is because we are taking input as string and not int.




#### Task Week 04
#### collatz.py

A program that read an integer input and if even divides by 2, if odd it multiplys by 3 and adds 1.
It outputs each calculation successively, separated by a space until it reaches the number "1"

Input a positive integer
While not equal to 1 (when == 1 end calc)
If int is even -> divide by 2
If int is odd  -> multiply by 3 and add 1
Output successive calcs on 1 line separated by a space until program end
